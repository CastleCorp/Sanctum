# *Sanctum* [![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)

### About
Sanctum is a native client for Mac OSX that provides direct desktop access to SAS faculty web resources, including Socrates and Saintsplex. Sanctum is packaged for Mac OSX and Linux systems (beta) as a stand-alone app. 

##### Versioning:
Sanctum uses the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) standard. It is currently at v1.0.0

### Installing
To install Sanctum, please visit the [releases](/releases/) page and download the correct package for your system. Open the downloaded file, and place *Sanctum.app* in your Applications directory (for OSX users this is *~/Applications*). When it has been copied over, go to your Applications directory and find the app titled *Sanctum*, with the SAS logo: ![SAS logo](http://okvideode.com/onlineordering/images/St%20Andrew's.png)

Click on Sanctum and it will open, with the application showing on your dock. ***That's it!***

*If you try and install the app and receive a popup telling you that it can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer, please see [this page](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18657?locale=en_US) for instructions on fixing it. The reason for this is that the only certification I have is this: [![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/certified-snoop-lion.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)*

### Bugs/Issues:
There are probably some things I overlooked. If you find any bugs please open a new issue and I will work on fixing it quickly.

### Todo:
- [x] Push v1.0.0 release
- [ ] Find Canvas iframe embed block workaround locally
